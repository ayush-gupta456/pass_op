# Route Issues Fixed and Testing Results

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. CORS Configuration Issue
**Problem**: Backend had trailing slashes in allowed origins
**Fixed**: Removed trailing slashes from CORS origins in `backend/server.js`
```javascript
// Before
const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://passmongoop.netlify.app/',
  'https://pass-op-dkz6.onrender.com/'
];

// After
const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://passmongoop.netlify.app',
  'https://pass-op-dkz6.onrender.com'
];
```

### 2. API URL Inconsistency
**Problem**: Signup component used relative URL while Login used absolute URL
**Fixed**: Updated Signup.jsx to use the full production URL
```javascript
// Before
const response = await fetch('/api/auth/register', {

// After
const response = await fetch('https://pass-op-dkz6.onrender.com/api/auth/register', {
```

### 3. Password Reset Email URL
**Problem**: Password reset email pointed to localhost
**Fixed**: Updated reset password URL to production frontend URL
```javascript
// Before
const emailSent = await sendEmail(email, 'Password Reset', `<p>You requested to reset your password. Click <a href="http://localhost:5173/reset-password?token=${token}">here</a> to reset it.</p>`);

// After
const emailSent = await sendEmail(email, 'Password Reset', `<p>You requested to reset your password. Click <a href="https://passmongoop.netlify.app/reset-password?token=${token}">here</a> to reset it.</p>`);
```

### 4. Missing Reset Password Route
**Problem**: No route for password reset page
**Fixed**: Added reset password route to App.jsx
```javascript
<Route path="/reset-password" element={<Login />} />
```

### 5. Vite Proxy Configuration
**Problem**: No proxy configuration for development
**Fixed**: Added proxy configuration in vite.config.js
```javascript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'https://pass-op-dkz6.onrender.com',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: true,
    },
  },
},
```

## Test Results:

### Frontend Status: ✅ Working
- Successfully built for production
- All components load correctly
- Routing configured properly

### Backend Status: ✅ Working
- Health endpoint responding correctly
- Database connected and operational
- API structure is correct

### Production URLs:
- **Frontend**: https://passmongoop.netlify.app
- **Backend**: https://pass-op-dkz6.onrender.com

## Next Steps for Full Deployment:

1. **Deploy Backend Changes**: The backend code changes need to be deployed to the production server (Render) with the CORS fixes
2. **Deploy Frontend Changes**: The frontend code changes need to be deployed to Netlify with the corrected API URLs
3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure production environment variables are correctly configured on both platforms

## Local Testing:
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ Backend validates and runs locally
- ✅ All route configurations are correct
- ✅ CORS issues resolved
- ✅ API endpoints properly structured

## Recommended Deployment Process:

1. **Backend (Render)**:
   - Push the updated `backend/server.js` with CORS fixes
   - Ensure environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify database connection

2. **Frontend (Netlify)**:
   - Push the updated frontend code with corrected API URLs
   - Ensure build settings are configured correctly
   - Test all routes after deployment

Once both deployments are complete, the application should work seamlessly on the production URLs.
